# CIS667-final-project
cheapest flight tickets search:
Didn't use anyone's existing code, just followed some similar strategies from our hw codes.
I integrate all my code in a single py file, but without the NN training my heuristic function yet. Will added later.
Size represent the number of different cities, G is a list of tuples, each tuple represent a pair of cities that have direct flight, and ticket price. Didtance is a 2D array, each element Distance[i][j] represent the Euclidiean distance between city i and city j.
Distance matrix, G, size (start city and end city are all generated randomly, (not all pair of cities have direct flight)
cheapest path and cheapest price will be printed finally
Experiment can be repeated anytimes.
